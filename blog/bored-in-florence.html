      <p class="blog-date">09.05.2025</p>

      <p>I didn’t plan anything. I just drank a coffee in the late morning and let the streets of Florence decide where I’d go.</p>
      <p>With Clairo humming softly through my iPod, I wandered past sunlit façades and distracted tourists.
        No destination. Just motion.</p>
      <p>Somehow I ended up almost at Cascine Park. I didn’t even realize I’d walked that far.</p>
      <p> Maybe that’s what I like most about this place — the way time fades into the cobblestones when you’re not watching.</p>
