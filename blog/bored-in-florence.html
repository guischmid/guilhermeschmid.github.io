  <p>I didn’t plan anything. I just drank a coffee in the late morning and let the streets of Florence decide where I’d go.</p>

  <p>With Clairo humming softly through my iPod, I wandered past sunlit façades and distracted tourists.<br>
  No destination. Just motion.</p>

  <p>Somehow I ended up almost at Cascine Park. I didn’t even realize I’d walked that far.</p>

  <p>Maybe that’s what I like most about this place — the way time fades into the cobblestones when you’re not watching.</p>
