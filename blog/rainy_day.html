      <p>Rain changes the pace of Florence. The usual hum of the city softens, and everything seems to slow down just a little. Streets glisten under umbrellas, and the sound of footsteps mixes with the steady rhythm of falling rain.</p>
      <p>[This morning, I walked past Santa Croce as a light drizzle turned into a steady shower. People ducked into cafés, warming their hands on coffee cups, while others strolled quietly, unbothered by the weather. The scent of rain on old stone and fresh pastries filled the air.</p>
      <p>By the time I reached the Arno, the river was rippling with raindrops, carrying leaves and reflections under the bridges. The Ponte Vecchio felt more peaceful than usual—fewer crowds, quieter conversations, and shop windows glowing softly against the grey sky.</p>
      
      <p>Florence in the rain isn’t any less beautiful. It’s just different. More thoughtful. More still. A reminder that not every moment here has to be sunny to be special.</p>
