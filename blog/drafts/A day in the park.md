# A day in the park

On quiet days  - like on the *Festa dei lavoratori -* I like to go to my local park *Parco di Villa Il Ventaglio* a nice patch of green in the cobblestone jungle of Florence. There lies a small pond filled with tortoise, swimming in the cool water and sunning on the stones by the pond. I love to just observe them for a while every time i go there, it's a small and beatiful ritual for me.

Afterwards I find myself a quiet spot on one of the many stone benches or under a small tree. Although it's difficult to find a quiet place in this park, you're always surrounded by playing children and teenagers enjoying the day off.

But I don't complain about the company, it's always nice too sometimes just observe the others seeing them laugh, talk and smile, it reminds one that every one of them is a person living their own life, dreaming, hoping, just like I am.

Sometimes I read a book, sometimes I doodle in my notebook or bring my iPad with me and study a for bit. But most of the time I just like to sit there and take in all impressions: the smell of the grass, the sound of the playing children, the feeling of the  cool wind on my skin.

When I leave all those impressions stay with me just for a while as I enter the buzzing streets and are reminded that I'm in the city.
