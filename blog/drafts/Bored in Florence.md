# A Slow Day in Florence  
*April 7, 2025*

I didn’t plan anything. I just drank a coffee in the late morning and let the streets of Florence decide where I’d go.

With Clairo humming softly through my iPod, I wandered past sunlit façades and distracted tourists.  
No destination. Just motion.

Somehow I ended up almost at Cascine Park. I didn’t even realize I’d walked that far.

Maybe that’s what I like most about this place — the way time fades into the cobblestones when you’re not watching.
